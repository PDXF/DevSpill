Site’s mostly up and running now. You can post, read, and it no longer slams GitHub every time someone visits. Solid progress.

Deleting posts?
Still broken.

Right now it just throws a "disabled" label on the post and hides it in the UI. Doesn’t actually delete anything—just makes it disappear on the surface.

Proper delete system coming later. Probably.
