# First Spill

lol

Okay but for real — this is DevSpill. I made this because I needed a place that wasn’t corporate, wasn’t polished to death, and didn’t care about being “content.” It’s just for devs. Messy, chaotic, open-source-soaked devs. I wanted a space where we could spill what we’re working on, thinking about, or completely failing at — without trying to package it for likes or marketing buzzwords.

It’s raw on purpose. Built fast, changed often, and owned by no one but the people who contribute. Valk might host it, but it’s not some brand vehicle. It’s a home for weird ideas, random logs, maybe a rant or two. No pressure, no polish — just spills.

This is the first one. Welcome to the dump.
