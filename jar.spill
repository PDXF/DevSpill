compiling minecraft mods is a hate crime
you don't write code. you write configs to convince gradle to maybe let you compile something that might run in a version of minecraft that changed its obfuscation mappings for the 400th time.

fabric, forge, architectury—pick your poison. none of them work cleanly. every tutorial is outdated. every dependency breaks. you solve one problem and ten more crawl out of the build.gradle like it's a clown car.

and god help you if you want mixins. want to remap jars? too bad, the toolchain is duct tape and prayers.
want IDE support? lmao.

every time i compile a mod that works i feel like a shaman who accidentally summoned a stable build through ritual and blood.

minecraft modding is not programming. it's surviving.
