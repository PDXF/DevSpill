It always starts the same:
Small team. Cool idea. GitHub repo. MIT license. “Built for the community.”

And it’s actually good.
People contribute. It grows. It solves real problems. It becomes a daily driver for devs everywhere.

Then it gets popular.
Then it gets investors.
Then it gets... locked down.

    “We're introducing a new license.”
    “Enterprise features only.”
    “Support our sustainable future.”
    Yeah right. Just say you sold out.

The community built it. The hype came from us. Now we need a subscription just to use what we helped make?

It’s genuinely sad watching open source become bait for VC money. The worst part? We’ve seen it so many times, we expect it now.
